# Notifiarr Indexer Reactions

This is a set of emojis for usenet indexers created to be used as reactions in Discord when using [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.com).  All emojis are 108x108 PNG files to match the recommended specs for Discord.  Some indexers have alternate styles to choose from.

## Why?

I wanted to set usenet indexer reactions for Discord notifications from Notifiarr but was struggling for many of them to find anything suitable that wasn't a favicon, barely legible or in irregular dimensions.  So I decided to create my own set which would match the Discord emoji requirements, have a consistent style and be easy to differentiate at a glance given the small size of reactions.  Where good quality assets were unavailable I created new ones matching or inspired by the original style where I could and used a machine learning tool to increase resolution where I couldn't.

After plenty of revisions and tweaks I ended up with a set I was happy with and which seem to work well so I decided to post them here as is in case other Notifiarr users find any of them useful.

## How to use

1.  Download and extract the [latest release for the emoji package](https://github.com/thatbritguy/notifiarr-indexer-reactions/releases/latest).
2.  In the Discord server navigate to ***Server Settings>Emoji>Upload Emoji*** and upload the PNG files located in the `indexer-reactions` folder you extracted in the previous step.  After uploading you can rename any emoji if desired.
3.  Navigate to the ***Discord Settings*** in the Notifiarr interface and follow the instructions to set your newly uploaded emoji as indexer reactions.
